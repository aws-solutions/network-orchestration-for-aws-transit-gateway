# This is an optional CloudFormation template for the AWS Organizations Management account
# This template creates an IAM role can be used to enhance the information
# in STNO, specifically allowing the UI and TGW attachment tags to include the 
# account name, and OU. 

# (An alternative to creating this CloudFormation stack is to register the STNO hub account 
# as the delegated administrator for any service, for example service catalog:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html
# This will allow the STNO hub account to query the AWS Organization information directly 
# without needing an IAM role
